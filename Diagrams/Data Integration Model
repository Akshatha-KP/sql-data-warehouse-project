This integration model illustrates how customer,product, and transactional data flows between the CRM system and the ERP system to create a unified, 
enriched dataset for downstream analytics

🔵 CRM Domain

The CRM system serves as the primary source for customer details, product information, and sales/transactional records.

crm_sales_details provides transaction‐level data for sales and orders, linking customers (cst_id) and products (prd_key).

crm_cust_info contains core customer profiles, which are later enriched with additional ERP attributes.

prd_info stores current and historical product information referenced in sales activity.

🟡 ERP Domain

The ERP system contributes additional attributes required to enhance CRM data and support enterprise reporting.

erp_cust_az12 adds customer attributes such as birthdates and other extended information.

erp_loc_a101 enriches customers with geographical or location-based data.

erp_px_cat_g1v2 provides product category mappings used to classify CRM product data.

🔗 Integration Logic

Data from CRM tables is matched with ERP tables using shared keys (cst_id, cid, or prd_key). This enables:

Creating a unified, enriched Customer Master by combining CRM core profiles with ERP attributes.

Linking enriched dimensions back to CRM transactions for complete analytic models.


Enhancing Product Master data with ERP category mappings.
